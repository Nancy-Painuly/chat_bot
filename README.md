*DISCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT*:

This is a simple real-time chat application built using Socket.IO for the backend and React for the frontend. It demonstrates live messaging capabilities between multiple users in real-time using WebSockets. The project is designed to be lightweight yet functional, focusing on core concepts like socket communication, frontend interaction, and UI responsiveness.

Technologies Used
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO

Frontend: React, Socket.IO Client

Communication: WebSockets

Environment: Vite (for fast React dev environment) or Create React App

 Project Features
Real-time chat using WebSockets (Socket.IO)
Simple and clean React UI
Shows live messages instantly to all connected users
Auto-scroll chat window
Timestamp on each message

Easy to extend for features like usernames, rooms, emojis, or authentication
How It Works
When a user sends a message, it is sent to the backend server using a Socket.IO event. The server then broadcasts the message to all connected clients. On receiving the message, each client updates its own UI to show the new message in real-time.

The backend uses Express.js to serve the application and handle socket connections, while Socket.IO manages all the WebSocket interactions.

Learning Outcomes
This project helped me understand:
The fundamentals of WebSocket communication
How Socket.IO makes real-time messaging simpler
Basic React state and event handling
Clean separation of backend and frontend
Setting up a full-stack app in a modular way
